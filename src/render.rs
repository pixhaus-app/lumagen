//! Background map renderer. CPU rasterization + thumbnailing are too expensive for the UI
//! frame thread, so this module owns a single dedicated worker thread: the UI enqueues
//! [`RenderRequest`]s and drains finished [`RenderResult`]s each frame, calling
//! `request_repaint` so a finished job surfaces immediately. Only the cheap
//! `Context::load_texture` upload stays on the UI thread.
